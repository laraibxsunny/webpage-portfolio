        <h2>The Big 3</h2>
          <p>
            "The Big 3" refers to the 3 hobbies I love and have the most interest in. From the "The Big 3", I show a lot of skills and qualities
            any team would desire to have.

                  Bowling has been the source of my satisfaction and teamworking skills these past few years. I bowl every week with my team during the
                  league seasons that run for months at a time each year. I've become a devoted captain of the team and relish working with the other
                  members so that we can place high in the league table every season but also aid eachother in improving our bowling skills together.
                  Just above is my home center in Stroud which I drive 1 hour to every week!

                  The picture above is my coach Mario. Yes, he is a scary man. Despite that he instructs some of the most tough Mauy Thai or 
                  Brazillian-Jiu-Jutsu classes in Bristol. Through going to Mario's classes I have assimilated a type of discipline I never thought
                  existed inside of me. I have a passion for MMA due to the technical skill behind the sport that I strive to comprehend more and more every
                  session that I go to.

                  Valorant isn't just a video game to me. From being a stress-reliever, improving my team skills and helping me know that
                  I enjoy deep-analysis, Valorant has aided in making me who I am today. I constantly am in the top 4k players out of millions 
                  and that is due to my desire for my team to win not just my solo performance. This game is the sole reason I grasped the true concept
                  of "there is no 'I' in team". Also the hobby which made me look into coding through game-development,
                  trying to comprehende how the application was made is what brought me to Software Development.
